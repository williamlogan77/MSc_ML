# MSc Machine Learning Module

The objective of this project was to take a given dataset around second-hand cars with their associated prices and create a model that accurately predicts the price of the cars given specific features.


The files in this respository include an executive summary, with related code/findings and a `.html` file containing the training and configuration of the model.

The model was deployed and trained using Microsoft Azure's service, leveraging the GPUs that were available at the time.
